I am Ygor Goulart, a self-taught frontend developer. I've been a designer for moree than 10 years and discovered my love for coding a year ago and have been pursuing it ever since. In a short year, I have completed several bootcamps and worked on various small and medium projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

My drive for knowledge and growth has led me to pursue a computer science bachelor's degree, and I am excited to bring my newfound knowledge to my future projects.

Join me on my journey as a frontend developer and follow my work here on GitHub!
